Open space is used by many folks at various times of the day and night.  Gaint Mushroon is a larger-than-man-sized popup structure and information kiosk is the shape of a mushroom.  The top cover or cap of the shroom is an umbrella type structure made of tarp or waterproof canvas material firmly attached to ring of wood by grommets and pins.  By Day, DryShroom can provide a place to get out of the rain for a bit.  Just big enough to get under, 4 people could hang out and do things like charge a cell phone on the provided USB ports that are fed from a battery that charges from solar cells in the roof.  There are also some cheap tablets that charge from the same device.  These tablets are loaded with useful information like downtown shopping maps, lists of resources for the underserved, and maybe a calendar of events.  At night the Gaint Mushroom will light up with LEDs positioned in the roof.  This will create a welcoming glow at a distance and help illuminate the ground around where the mushroom is placed.  Like mushrooms in the forest, these mushrooms will not last forever. They are designed to be harvested and transported where they are needed most.  All the parts will pop or slide apart.  If you dig deep enough in the tablet there will be instructions for dismantling and rebuilding it.  Weâ€™ll encourage folks to take pictures of new configurations and placements with the hashtag GiantMushroom.
